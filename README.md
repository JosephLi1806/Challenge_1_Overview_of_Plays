# Challenge_1_Overview_of_Plays

Purpose
> The purpose of this analysis is to explain when are the best times and the outcomes of when and what plays can be profitable. 

Analysis/Challenges 
> The challenges that I have faced while completeing this Challenge were finding the right formula and what information was needed to be inputted to find out if the data was correct or not.
> I have reached out to the TA's for assistants on figuring out what I have done wrong and what was needed to be changed, but some where still very difficult at the end. While inputing the formula in Outcomes Based on Goals, I thought I had the right formula but the graph wasn't correct, I have attempted to select different columns to correct the formula, but still didn't have much luck in the end.

Results
> In conclusion about when you should and should not launch a play is that you will have a more successful play that will either reach your goal or exceed it is by having them in the beginning of May through the end of June. Those months are the best time to launch a play. If you were to start a play on October you will have more plays that have failed.

> My conclusion on Outcomes on goals are you have a higher success rate if your aimming around $35,000 to $45,000.

> Limitations based on the information we currently have is that we can't tell which plays have been more successful and what type of genre people are more interested.
> Other possible table/graphs we could of pulled were the average donations on which plays had the highest donations and success rate.
